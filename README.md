# taskinator
An application that allows users to create a task and assign it as something "To-Do", "In Progress", or "Completed". 

## Description

This application uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, webAPI's and the DOM to create a Kaban-like To-Do List.  The user can add tasks "To Do", and as the task is worked on, move it along to "In Progress" and eventually to "Tasks Completed". This is a great way to keep track of your projects; see what needs to be done and what has already been finished!

This project's goal was to utilize web Storage APIs and use local storage to maintain data on the page even when the brower is refreshed. This project improved my understanding of the window object and utilizing the DOM API methods to handle events like button clicks; this project also helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills to create basic structure and design.
